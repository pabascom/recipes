Ingredients:
- Three eggs
- Three slices of sourdough bread
- Grass-fed butter
- Jam or preserves
- Salt

Directions:
1: Melt butter in a small frying pan
2: Break eggs into pan
3: While the eggs fry, toast bread slices
4: Wait. Empty the dishwasher or something.
5: When the toast is done, spread butter on it.
	Make sure you keep an eye on the eggs.
6: When the egg whites are about half cooked,
	turn off the burner and flip the eggs. Leave
	them in the pan while you finish the toast.
	This will ensure cooked whites and a runny
	yolk (but not so runny it makes a mess).
7: By now the butter should have melted. Spread
	it on the toast.
8: Spread jam on the toast. (Raspberry is best.)
9: But marmelade is good, too.
10: Anything tart, really.
11: Place one egg on each slice of toast. (Trust,
	it's delic.)
12: Salt to taste.
13: Taste.
